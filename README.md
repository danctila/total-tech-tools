## Usage
- This project was started with Vite using React + TypeScript combo
- The UI design was done using Chakra UI

## Reflection

**- What was the context for this project?**

In starting Total Tech Tools, a freelance web design agency, I needed a company website. This was my version of a web design site using modern technologies including ReactJS that met my desired needs such as a responsive UI, functional form which can send emails, etc.

**- What did I end up building?**

The final project is a website hosted at https://totaltechtools.com. This site has an animated navigation modal on mobile devices, a validated form which sends emails to me via EmailJS, striking effects, and a clean, modern design.

**- What tools did I use?**

For the functional development, TypeScript was used instead of JavaScript for stronger type support as well as Chakra UI as a design tool to speed up my work flow. Figma was used for initial mockups as well as Fontsource for fonts. Varius react libraries were used for effects ( [react-parallax](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax "react-parallax") and [react-typing-effect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typing-effect "react-typing-effect")). Email JS was used to take form data and send it to my email when users fill out the form.
